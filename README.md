## What is DENTEX?
We present the Dental Enumeration and Diagnosis on Panoramic X-rays Challenge (DENTEX), organized in conjunction with the International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) in 2023. The primary objective of this challenge is to develop algorithms that can accurately detect abnormal teeth with dental enumeration and associated diagnosis. This not only aids in accurate treatment planning but also helps practitioners carry out procedures with a low margin of error.

The challenge provides three types of hierarchically annotated data and additional unlabeled X-rays for optional pre-training. The annotation of the data is structured using the Fédération Dentaire Internationale (FDI) system. The first set of data is partially labeled because it only includes quadrant information. The second set of data is also partially labeled but contains additional enumeration information along with the quadrant. The third data is fully labeled because it includes all quadrant-enumeration-diagnosis information for each abnormal tooth, and all participant algorithms will be benchmarked on the third data. 

DENTEX aims to provide insights into the effectiveness of AI in dental radiology analysis and its potential to improve dental practice by comparing frameworks that simultaneously point out abnormal teeth with dental enumeration and associated diagnosis on panoramic dental X-rays.

The DENTEX dataset comprises panoramic dental X-rays obtained from three different institutions using standard clinical conditions but varying equipment and imaging protocols, resulting in diverse image quality reflecting heterogeneous clinical practice. The dataset includes X-rays from patients aged 12 and above, randomly selected from the hospital's database to ensure patient privacy and confidentiality.

To enable effective use of the FDI system, the dataset is hierarchically organized into three types of data;

*   (a) 693 X-rays labeled for quadrant detection and quadrant classes only,

*   (b) 634 X-rays labeled for tooth detection with quadrant and tooth enumeration classes,

*   (c) 1005 X-rays fully labeled for abnormal tooth detection with quadrant, tooth enumeration, and diagnosis classes.

The diagnosis class includes four specific categories: caries, deep caries, periapical lesions, and impacted teeth. An additional 1571 unlabeled X-rays are provided for pre-training. 

* The dataset is used for [DENTEX (Dental Enumeration and Diagnosis on Panoramic X-rays Challenge)](https://dentex.grand-challenge.org/). 

**Data Split for Evaluation and Training**

The DENTEX 2023 dataset comprises three types of data: (a) partially annotated quadrant data, (b) partially annotated quadrant-enumeration data, and (c) fully annotated quadrant-enumeration-diagnosis data. The first two types of data are intended for training and development purposes, while the third type is used for training and evaluations.

To comply with standard machine learning practices, the fully annotated third dataset, consisting of 1005 panoramic X-rays, is partitioned into training, validation, and testing subsets, comprising 705, 50, and 250 images, respectively. Ground truth labels are provided only for the training data, while the validation data is provided without associated ground truth, and the testing data is kept hidden from participants.

**Annotation Protocol**

The DENTEX provides three hierarchically annotated datasets that facilitate various dental detection tasks: (1) quadrant-only for quadrant detection, (2) quadrant-enumeration for tooth detection, and (3) quadrant-enumeration-diagnosis for abnormal tooth detection. Although it may seem redundant to provide a quadrant detection dataset, it is crucial for utilizing the FDI Numbering System. The FDI system is a globally-used system that assigns each quadrant of the mouth a number from 1 through 4. The top right is 1, the top left is 2, the bottom left is 3, and the bottom right is 4. Then each of the eight teeth and each molar are numbered 1 through 8. The 1 starts at the front middle tooth, and the numbers rise the farther back we go. So for example, the back tooth on the lower left side would be 48 according to FDI notation, which means quadrant 4, number 8. Therefore, the quadrant segmentation dataset can significantly simplify the dental enumeration task, even though evaluations will be made only on the fully annotated third data.
